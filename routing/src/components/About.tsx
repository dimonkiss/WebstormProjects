                "Starry Night" is one of the most famous paintings by Vincent van Gogh, created in 1889
                while he was a patient at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, France.
                The painting is known for its swirling blue night sky punctuated by vibrant stars and a small
                village in the foreground.

                "Starry Night" an iconic piece of art. The painting reflects van Gogh's emotional and
                psychological state during his turbulent times.
